@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use GPIO to blink LEDs.
	Process:
		- Configure pin as GPIO function
		- Configure system tick
		- Depend on a limited tick value to turn on and turn off LED.
					
@Directory contents:
	\Keil:	includes Keil project and configuration files  
	lpc43xx_libcfg_default.h: Library configuration file - include needed driver library for this example 
	Gpio_LedBlinky.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
		LPC4330	Xplorer Board
		
						
	Running mode:
		Internal SRAM mode:	This example can run on Internal SRAM mode.
		SPIFI 32MB Debug mode:
			+ This example can be run on external SPIFI flash:
					- Burn by Keil's Load feature:
						a) Copy all things in ..\..\CMSISv2p10_LPC43xx_DriverLib\Tools\Flash\Keil_Binaries to
						   C:\Keil\ARM\Flash (Keil uVision 4)
						b) Open Keil->Configure for flash compiling->Compile->Select debugger->Press LOAD


	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Run example and observe LED's D2 and D3 start to Blink.
		
@Tip:
	- Open \Keil\*.uvproj project file to run example on Keil
