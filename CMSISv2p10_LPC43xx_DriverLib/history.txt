History of updates to CMSISv2p10_LPC43xx_DriverLib
==================================================

Important - the code in this project is targeted at the 
LPC43xx "Rev A" parts. It is not suitable for use with LPC43xx 
"Rev -" parts.

Note that this project provides both the basic CMSIS
headers, as well as NXP's LPC43xx peripheral driver 
code which sit on top of CMSIS.

---------------
Updated to use code from the LPC4350A_PDL released by NXP 
through lpcware.com on 2012-01-25 (file version 2012-01-17).

Changes from from NXP release include:
- Fixed #include "lpc43xx.h t" -> "LPC43xx.h" throughout.

LPC43xx CMSIS-Compliant Standard Peripheral Firmware
Driver Library (RELEASE: LPC4300CMSIS_20111209).


Files changed from NXP release include:

* lpc43xx_libcfg_default.h
